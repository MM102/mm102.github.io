		<h1>Hi I'm Nathan!</h1>
		<h2 class="h1-related">You may know me as MM102.</h2>

		<p>...Or you just don't know me, in which case, hello!<br>I consider myself to be a <em>visual generalist</em> (self credited) and coding hobbyist. My forte been doing pixel art and illustration since I was 9 years old. As well as having experience in animation, video editing, compositing, motion graphics, general 3D, and more.</p>
		<p>I love to learn new skills and programs to build things for myself (to a fault admittedly). Obtaining new forms of creative control is extremely enjoyable. I even taught myself HTML, CSS and JS to format this website just how I like.</p>

		<div class="full-width bg-light">
			<p>Here are some art programs I've dabbled in over the years:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Aseprite</li>
				<li>YY-CHR</li>
				<li>Clip Studio Paint</li>
				<li>Blender</li>
				<li>Davinci Resolve</li>
				<li>Adobe After Effects</li>
				<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
				<li>Affinity Photo</li>
				<li>Affinity Designer</li>
				<li>Medibang Paint</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Pixel Art</h2>
		<p>Like I stated before, I've been doing pixel art since I was 9 years old so its a definite passion of mine. A lot of my most recent pixel art is SMW related since that's my main hobby, but I'm pretty flexible in terms of style when given the chance. Heres a small collection, check out more in my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>!</p>

		<h2>SMW Hacking</h2>
		<p>My main hobby is Super Mario World hacking, so a lot of my work is focused around the SNES and it's graphical abilities which I find very fun to work around.</p>
		<p>I've participated and placed highly in many contests surrounding SMW for level design and graphics. <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=26615">You can see some of the virtual trophies here.</a> Some notable placings being <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=122151">2nd place in VLDC 13</a>, the most popular SMWC contest with over 85 entries that year, 1st place in QLDC 2023, and various graphics awards.</p>
		<p>I've also done graphics work for some <a href="https://youtu.be/yARetgEZnEM?t=168">SMW related Games Done Quick events</a>, and one <a href="https://youtu.be/gjYyP23uF2c?t=35">TASBot GDQ Segment</a>.</p>

				<p class="text-light">My submission to CLDC 2020.<br>I still love how this turned out theming and graphics wise. I'm still surprised by how well I was able to recreate the film grain effect on the SNES. It all came together to snag a nice top 10 spot in the contest.</p>

		<h2>Video projects</h2>
		<p>I've also been a part of several large video projects! Some of which gaining over a million views on youtube. Most of them, while non-serious in nature, requiring a lot of work and collaboration. </p>

				<p class="text-light">I was asked to do the segment at 3:25-4:00 for this. I also contributed assets and feedback to various other sections including 1:58-2:18.<br><br>Having very limited experience of after effects at this time I'm still proud of how it turned out. </p>

				<p class="text-light">While not the most polished by my current standards, 3 friends and I parodied the Sonic Mania Trailer when I was only 16!<br><br>This was my first time having an idea this big, spearheading it, and seeing it through. The effort was meet with resounding success, gaining over a million views in a few months.</p>

				<p class="text-light">I wasn't as involved with the production side of this project. However I'm still really happy with my contribution at 16:50. The entire thing was animated entirely within Aseprite!</p>

		<h2>Illustration and 3D</h2>
		<p>While I haven't done any illustration or 3D modeling in any professional capacity I still enjoy doing them. Heres a small sample of my work, more available on the <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>.</p>
		<div class="full-width bg-light flow">
		<img src="img/illustration-preview.png" alt="various illustrations by me">
